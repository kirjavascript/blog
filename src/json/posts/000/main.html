        These pages are rendered entirely in vector graphics as 
        <span class="link" onClick="d3on('posts/000/popup.json',true)">data driven documents</span>. 
        This is probably a terrible idea as far as SEO is concerned, but who gives a shit about SEO when you have insane <a target="_blank" href="http://d3js.org">DOM manipulation</a>?</p>
